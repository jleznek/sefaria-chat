# Privacy Policy for Sefaria Chat

*Last updated: February 15, 2026*

Sefaria Chat does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to the app developer.

## Data stored locally on your device

- Your AI provider API keys (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Your chosen provider and model preferences
- Chat history for the current session

All settings are saved in a local file on your computer and are never sent to the developer or any third party.

## Third-party services

When you use the app, your messages are sent directly from your device to the AI provider you have configured (e.g., Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, or a local Ollama instance). These requests use your own API key and are governed by the respective provider's privacy policy. The app also connects to Sefaria's servers (sefaria.org) to retrieve Jewish text data.

## No analytics or telemetry

Sefaria Chat does not include any analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, or tracking of any kind.

## Contact
